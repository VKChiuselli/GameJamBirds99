Nesting Times Art Pack

Sprites, tiles and other art used in Nesting Times.

Nesting Times is my entry into OGA's Winter 2021 Game Jam.
Presented as my way of giving back to the OGA community and saying thanks to all the artists whose works contributed to the creation of Nesting Times, here are the original art and sound files from the game.

The beaky bird enemies are derivatives of bluecarrot16's [LPC] Bird set.
I recolored and 're-beaked' them to fit in the game's color palette.

Everything else included here is original art by me.
All done in the 6-bit Sega Master System palette.
